# resume-filter
This project is for hirers in tech companies.
This program lets the user input the requirements that an applicant must have to qualify for further rounds of interview, then filters out the resume files of the applicants that don't have the specified requirements and displays the files of the applicants that have met the requirements, i.e, are qualified for further rounds of interview.
